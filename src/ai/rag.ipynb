He explains things in a way that makes it easy to understand for almost everyone (new programmer friendly) and will go over things as many times as you need.

Bonus questions on tests.\", 'Mr. Steinberg had a great lecture structure: you follow along with the code building logic, he uses digital images to illustrate concepts, and he included funny little references to franchises in coding assignments.  I utilized the outside hours a lot; he helps guide you in the right direction without direct answers.  Head to office hours early!', \"Great at explaining the material but the pacing was not very good. Took the same amount of time to go over the easier material and the harder material which rushed us to wrap up the content at the end of the semester. Grading was inconsistent if you don't like your test grade the TAs graded wrong so go check it.\", \"Steinberg is honestly a really good lecturer and I understand why he is so highly rated, however he was just too paranoid and strict for me to enjoy the course as he didn't seem so forgiving if you are not as detail-oriented as him. Quizzes were online with 3 tries each, making them worth practicing instead of trying to just get the good grade.\", \"He's an excellent professor, has fair exams, and enjoyed the PAs. But, my biggest problem was him and his TAs when it came down to grading exam papers. All three of my exams had to be restored because the TA couldn't even read their own handwriting for a score and graded against the wrong version of the exam.
