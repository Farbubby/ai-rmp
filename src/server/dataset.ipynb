It probably does not help that I cannot pay attention during her lecture, due to her lack of ability to engage.', 'does not explain anything during lectures, she is just not a good teacher. way too much busy work for no reason (not like anyone knows how to do it anyways)', \"Danko has instructed a few of my classes in the past and she's one of my favorite professors I've had!

Didn't even tell us when the final was for our class until finals week. If you can, try taking this class with another prof.\", 'Exams were impossible and her communication of exam dates and content was poor. Assignments are easy and the material seems easy until you take the exams.', \"This was Dori's first semester teaching 310, and we had lots of issues with our exams. Exams alone make up 60% of your grade. You really have to put in effort and time if you want to pass this class. She was confusing most of the time, and I felt I could've done better in this class with a different prof. She's nice, but this class is difficult.\", \"310 isn't fun with whoever you take it with. It was Dori's first time teaching the class, so there were certainly some rough patches along the way. The exams weren't impossible, but she didn't give us much of a study guide to go off of. Just some practice exams. Overall, she wasn't too bad. She does want to help you, which counts for something.\"]\n",

This was the best class in the IS program because of how he ties everything together.\", 'This guy is the head of the computing program, and it shows why.  He really knows a LOT about the IT industry and what we need to know in our jobs.  The book is only used as extra reading cause the real material is in his analysis of current events.

Participation goes a long way for him and he creates a safe/comfortable space to do so. The work isn't too tedious and it can be fun! The purpose of the class can be confusing at first, but this isn't a traditional art class.\", 'At the beginning of the year he seemed a little disorganized, I wasnt really sure when things were due and that we he used google drive to turn things in instead of blackboard. But as the year went on that got better. He also students  them to try new ways of doing things. Probably not the best professor, and not the worse either.', '100% regret taking this class. Paul was rude and exceedingly dismissive, and while his instructions were incredibly vague, he somehow still had very specific ideas in mind of what he wanted. He talks a big game yet never seems able to form a coherent concept.', \"I took a few classes with Paul, and he's one of my favorite professors I've ever had. The comments on here about him being vague with criteria for projects are true, but to be honest I think that might just be inescapable with the conceptual and theoretical aspects of the class. He's one of those profs whose style you either click with or don't.\", \"Paul is an interesting dude. One second he is complimenting you and giving good feedback, and the next second he is being unclear in the directions, and tearing your project apart. By the end of the class you end up learning a lot without even realizing it, and producing really good work, but you'll probably pull your hair out and curse his name!!\", 'DON\\'T TAKE AS A GEN ED FOR ART. This class only makes sense for art majors, I\\'m serious. SO many non-art majors in my class struggled. But hes a great guy and I found the class pretty easy. You need to do the outside work or you will be behind. If you do what he says in critiques its an easy A. No \"free\" absences, you gotta go to class.', \"Hands down the worst professor I've ever had. He talks a big game and tries to sound smart by using a lot of random vocabulary but it just makes him sound like a jerk. He is so abstract and the criteria of the class is so unclear so you never know what you're doing. He is not willing to help his students, and just belittles you when you ask! 0/10\", \"An art class but do not expect to get any of your projects even close to done in class. The class is confusing to understand. I did not even understand the main concept of the course until the last week of class and so didn't my classmates. I would never take this class if you are not an art major. Terrible choice for a gen ed art class .\", \"Paul is the friendliest prof Ive ever had. Hes super approachable, doesnt get upset with his students when they can't do what's asked of them, and instead chats with them on the side to make sure theyre doing okay. My only complaint is that hes super vague about what he expects from you for each project, but its hard to be specific in art classes.\", 'Paul is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and allows so much freedom. Pushes you to be a better artist. Would definitely take again', \"Paul's by far one of my favorite professors; his passion for art is truly motivating and he is inspiring only if you care to decipher art and the philosophy behind it. He's vague on what is expected out of projects simply because he wants us to think for ourselves and find our own process in art. But once you get to know him, it's an easy A.\", 'paul gives little to no instructions on any of his random projects, he never gives due dates until the class before. Super unorganized and I spent an entire semester completely lost as to what was going on. Also, he grades based on his opinion of your work, not any specific criteria', \"One thing you have to understand before you take paul's class- especially CPS- he gives you freedom to figure out your own path. He gives unspecific critiques because he doesn't want to pigeon-hole people into his way of thinking. If you pay attention in class, and like to be stretched at to think for yourself, he is amazing.\", \"Paul is a super nice guy but you can't understand him. He doesn't clarify the projects. I took this cause I had to for foundations and I would NEVER do it again. You basically just do random stuff. You jump from project to project, sometimes 3 at a time and your always confused. He's crazy with the way he only cares about that class no other one.\", \"Paul is a really fun guy, and he's great to get along with, but the class has a lot of work to stay on top of. He talks a lot and it's usually not very interesting, I zoned out a lot. He gives you a lot of assignments and little to no directions on what to be doing.\", \"Paul is HILARIOUS! but his teaching could do some work... He is an amazing person but isn't very clear when describing the projects and giving you help..\", \"paul knows a lot about art but is so completely indecisive in expectations, organization, and just about everything you want a professor for.  he will not lead you to bettering yourself.  I've never felt so empty about art until his class. if you are taking him for cps know this is a weeding out class but it will also destroy your love of art.\", \"Paul is a pretty nutty guy, but his class discussions are funny; they're pretty long but still remarkably hilarious.  He is not very clear with instructions, so get the number of a classmate or two to help keep track of everything and get 2nd opinions.  He uses the Wiki heavily and that will be the basis of the info you get for projects.\", 'Group crits are a useless waste of time. Individual crits are almost as big of a waste of time. He likes projects to be done his way, his style. And the wiki will dominate your life.', 'I had Paul for Civic Studio. He is not always clear or easy to understand- but sometimes the things that come out of his mouth are really funny and random and make the class enjoyable. You will learn things about yourself and about the art world from this class. Warning: Paul will email you.. A LOT.']\n",

Not once this semester did she post an exam or quiz when she said she was going to. Though she is a great professor, she has caused me so much stress in not posting things so I had to plan my schedule around her disorganization multiple times.

Only gave quizzes/tests for grades but they were all open note and online. The tests/quizzes could be difficult but with the open note rule it was understandable. Overall a really great class.

Due to this, she does try to make you think by them, but they still are not very hard and automatically adds a point of E.C. She is encouraging and wants the best for her students.

The questions really make you think but she encourages everyone to use their notes. Take your time on the tests and honestly, you'll be fine!\", \"Hunt is an amazing person and is hilarious. She tries to keep everyone engaged and you can tell she loves what she does. With that said, this class is not easy. You will work your butt off to maintain a good grade and that still isn't enough sometimes. Her exams are super conceptual and HARD. Take Hunt but be ready to work!\", \"Jodee is enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and so funny. She is a wonderful lady. But her exams? So tough! The reading assignments are absolutely necessary. I cannot imagine having taken this class before COVID... She used to only allow students one page of notes on exams. She also didn't provide her lecture notes before 2020. I struggled for that A.\", \"I absolutely ADORED Prof. Hunt. Her lectures were so interesting and I actually was interested in stuff I usually don't care about. Her passion for the subject is apparent and her energy is honestly infectious. At least for this year, all of the tests were online and open note with around 48 hours to take each one. TAKE GOOD NOTES!!!!!\", 'Her test were extremely hard in my opinion. The test are written with multiple correct answers but one is more correct than the rest. If you are good at catching those fine details great. If not take another teacher.

Quizzes every week, 4 exams through out the year, no homework. She is not very good at communicating when quizzes and exams will be during the week and usually throws them out there whenever. Personally would not take her again.', 'Dr. Hunt is an amazing prof. She cares about her students succeeding and she is the sweetest person! However, she gives no homework. She only gives exams and quizzes every week. There definitely is not a cushion for your grade. You need to pay in lecture and take notes to do well in this class. A lot of effort required, but worth it!', 'I have taken a class with Dr. Hunt before and I loved her, but online format is not for her. If you can avoid taking an online class with her, DO IT! She posts way too much material and expects us to do it all within a week so she can post another quiz or exam for us to take. She does not answer emails and decided to do zooms at very random times', \"Taking this course online with her was a nightmare. She never actually lectured, she didn't answer questions/emails, & she refused to record the random zoom sessions that she just began offering mid-semester. She posts very complex quizzes every week at a different day/time, & that's all that's in the gradebook. Do not recommend.\", 'I took Prof. Hunt hoping that she would be incredible based on her reviews here. I was so so wrong. She is unable to teach through the online format. She ignores emails, teaches the class on a \"read the book\" basis, and posts quizzes and exams whenever she feels like it, with little to no notice and short time frames. Do not take her online.', \"RUN. I had a 4.0 before this class. She does not/will not teach the material. It's entirely up to your ability to read the text book and pray to god you understand it well enough to answer her incredibly specific, confusing quiz/exam questions. Didn't even get a zoom lecture until weeks into the course. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Do not take!!\"]\n",

I would definitely recommend this class with Burns.', \"Caring, kind, insightful, wise. Burns is a great prof and leads great discussions. Lots of readings but that's pretty typical for an honors class. you will need to actually read them and write reflections on them and then discuss the themes in class. He's an easy grader but that does not change the workload so factor that in. Would take again 100%\", \"He's just such a sweetie pie.

One of the best professors I've ever had. \", \"I honestly learned fr life skills/lessons in this class it was really fun to be a part of. We did a lot of reading and writing but if you spread it out throughout the week it's not bad. You're opinion is valued and important in this class. He always says it's the most difficult A you'll ever receive(true). Fast talker but love his teaching\", \"This capstone was interesting. The class itself is fine, mainly discussion-based. It's the homework that makes this class harder to enjoy. Each week we were assigned about 8 articles and we had to complete write ups, I'd be turning in 11-12 pages of writing every week. If you're willing to do the work, he's a great prof! If not, find someone else. \", 'Dr. Burns was AMAZING! The class was easy to navigate and it was intellectually stimulating, but very rewarding.

I had to read the book to do well on the exams, but if you pass those you're pretty much set. There are 4 exams and 6 quizzes (both of which he drops the lowest grade) and he offers an optional paper that will shift the point distribution to provide more leeway. \", \"Burns is such a nice person. This class was just more work than I expected (in person) because we had write-ups due each week. There are 3 exams which are essay exams (3 questions). Burns sometimes goes off on tangents and it confused me when listening to his lectures. He also talks really fast which is confusing at times too but he's not bad. \", \"Professor Burns is such a wonderful and caring professor! If you show up and do the work, you'll do great. He puts so much effort into his lectures, discussions, and PowerPoints. He's also very understanding and sweet! \", 'Dr. Burns is a great professor, and this is one of the best classes I have taken in my college career.

What an amazing guy!', \"Larry cares about his students & makes sure everyone understands. He talks a tad fast but you to get used to it. Lectures are very engaging & he includes quick personal stories. Not mandatory to go, but the in class videos are always on exams. 4 exams & 5 quizzes, both lowest are dropped. There's an optional paper if you want to increase your grade\", \"Such an easy class if you take good notes and use the practice exams. I had this class in person and it consisted of 4 exams and 5 quizzes. He drops your lowest quiz AND lowest exam. No papers or assignments. He does talk VERY fast and it can be hard to keep up in lectures, but it isn't terrible. He lectures right off the PowerPoint. Great class\", \"Prof. Burns was one of the best profs I've had at GVSU. Really cares about his students, and always wants to hear what they have to say. His Capstone is discussion-based, make sure that you do the required readings so you're prepared to discuss in class. It can sound daunting but it was a really great class and I have no complaints.\", \"Took this online, and we didn't have a single exam. Just had modules with several assignments through the online textbook. Had 5 or 6 150-200 word reflections about content covered and that was it. Lecture videos consisted of 2 minute overviews of content each week. Very nice prof and easiest A you will ever get. \", 'Professor Burns is truly one of the best!!! He is super caring and helpful. His capstone class is discussion-based and he does an amazing job at remaining unbiased. One of the best classes I took in my whole college career.', \"Larry is absolutely amazing and so caring. Makes sure to give attention to every student. Four exams, lowest grade is dropped. You do have the read the textbook chapters in order to get a good grade on the exams.

She is an awesome professor. She assigns a LOT of pre-class homework, but usually it can get done in about 15 minutes.

The whole class was through Mcgraw Hill and connect assignments. If you don't mind doing those then this is the class for you. We had two writing assignments and one group assignment that isn't bad at all. Overall he's a great professor with clear grading criteria. \", 'Amazing, take take take. ', 'sweetest prof ever', 'Rod was a G. Definitely recommend to other gvsu students. ', 'I love Prof Morgan. I have him online so I dont really know him that well, but I met with him for office hours and it was very obvious that he really cares about his students, beyond just homework. He is so understanding with mental health and gives extensions if theyre needed. Highly recommend taking his class if you have the chance.', \"Hes by far one my my favorite professors here! He's so nice, understadning, and makes lecture/lab alot of fun and interesting, cant say that about many profs. He is very clear on what to expect for exams and doesnt expect you to know every detail but the main concept to your understanding. Hes a pretty easy grader I would say compared to most.\", \"Morgan is an amazing professor. I've had him for a few classes and it's been great every time. The content is HARD, but he makes it bearable. I would dread coming to class if it wasn't for him! His study guides are pretty clear cut and the exams are hard just because of the content, but he gives TONS of partial credit.\", 'Professor Morgan is an amazing teacher for lab. He walks students through every lab, and has you work on it in small chunks. Everything is taught in a clear and effective way, and he grades fairly easily. As someone who is always stressed over lab, I can say that Prof. Morgan made lab stress free and fun! Highly recommend, nice and easy professor.', \"This class was very organized. Students are required to READ the syllabus in order to know when assignments were due. Papers were really easy to write and were based on our own opinions. Definitely visit the writing center if you don't know how to write a paper on your own. The professor doesn't have a specific format he wants (argumentative, etc)\", \"Don't take this class if you want to actually learn about biomedical ethics. He only grades you and gives feedback on the mechanics of your papers. The course consisted of five 500 word papers and one final paper. He did not organize this summer class well, which left most students confused and/or missing deadlines because they were so sporadic.\", 'Dr. Morgan does a great job delivering content, but there is A LOT of it. Attending lecture was important and, even with great attendance, I used my textbook more in this class than any other. He does assign readings and WILL expect you to know information from the text. Mellow guy though, has a good sense of humor, and is helpful.', \"If you take BIO328 in the summer, he is transforming it into a hybrid. This makes the class very paper-heavy, but it is great not to have to come to class as much. Morgan is a really nice guy and he really knows his stuff. He gives great feedback on his papers and although the class isn't impossible, he definitely makes you work for your A.\", 'I always hated biology, but Professor Morgan actually made me enjoy it for once. His lectures were always engaging, and class typically ended fairly early. We also did some fun experiments in class (made yogurt, looked at pond water, etc). There was NO homework besides one 5 page paper on any topic along with 3 Exams, 3 Quizzes, and Final Exam.', 'He is a good professor overall, and willing to answer any questions. The class is made up of 3 exams, 3 quizzes, 1 research paper, and a final exam.', 'Prof. Morgan makes this course very interesting and engaging for non-science majors. He is very nice, and will answer all your Q\\'s! Biology is not my strong point, but he made the content easily understandable. There were a couple short \"fun\" in-class experiments. Grades are from exams, quizzes (fairly easy), and a short research paper.', \"Dr. Morgan is awesome. Science classes can be terrible if you're not a science major, but he taught the course in a simplified way that actually made it enjoyable. The tests were very fair, and overall the class was really enjoyable. I don't think there's a better honors science professor to take, so take this class.\", \"This guy is awesome! I'm an Accounting and MIS major so science isn't my strong point but he made it so much fun (for a 6-9) and kept us engaged in the class. He's super passionate about what he's teaching so it keeps you interested in the lectures. Super easy A. Just take notes on the lectures and reference the text book for terms you don't know.\", 'Dr. Morgan is great! He grades the assignments fairly and is very accessible outside of class and is willing to answer any questions. He genuinely wants you to do well. Take him if you can!']\n",

He is a very monotone speaker, so if you have trouble following heavy lecture classes with that kind of oration, don't take him. Otherwise, he is very clear with his expectations and provides his students with ample materials to succeed. I would recommend this class. \", 'Madsen is a funny great guy. Very easy to access outside of class and all of the exams/labs are very straight forward and he gives very helpful study guides. The lectures can get repetitive but he keeps them interesting. awesome and very knowledgeable dude', \"Professor Madsen is a nice guy, but his lectures are so boring. This class was more difficult than I expected it to be, but I have to take it for a lab requirement. He also goes very fast on the lectures so I feel I can't keep up. The exams aren't great either. I would not take him again. Also, the lab is really boring and the TAs suck.\", \"Not a bad class, the professor is nice and lets you correct one exam. The lectures were straightforward and posted online, making it easy to study for exams. Not super exciting, but if you pay attention or look back at the powerpoints, you'll be fine.\", \"Ngl, Prof Madsen doesn't make a ton of jokes, but when he does he's hilarious. This is a very lecture heavy class, but I couldn't ask for better lectures to take notes on. They are extremely well organized, and he doesn't ramble on. Just pay attention in class and you'll be fine.\", \"Prof Madsen didn't tell many jokes, but he could be really funny when he did. Any class with 1:15 long lectures will get dry after a while, but Madsen kept his lectures well organized and interesting enough. Easily the best lectures to take notes on I've had. The study guides are also really helpful for the exams.\", 'The first part of the course is really tough. But he let\\'s you \"correct\" one of the class exams, where you get back half of the points you lost by basically not doing much work. After that it\\'s really easy. You don\\'t have to even show up. Just make quizlets from the slides and practice exams are almost identical to the actual one. Labs are a pain.', \"Prof. Madsen is the type of professor that demands respect, not because he asks for it, but because he deserves it. My colloquium on nonrenewable & renewable energies was excellent. Do expect to write a few papers, but you have lots of room to write about what you enjoy. I'd take him again in a heartbeat. His canvas can be a little unorganized tho.\", \"Very cool guy. Lectures aren't necessary but helpful if you go. He posts all his slides on canvas. Super helpful outside of class\", 'A great guy! He is so kind and allows you to do test corrections on one exam grade that you would like to raise. The material is understandable and he does not try to try trick you in any way on the exams. As long as you do the study guides he posts, you will be prepared . Exams themselves are very fair and he wants everyone to do well! :)', 'One of the nicest Professors I have ever had. Dr. Madsen is very knowledgable about his subject and cares about his students. If you put in the effort and ask for help he will ensure you pass. He allows test corrections for half points back on one exam. Lectures are boring but worth going to because he mentions things that will be on the exam.', \"If you're taking this for a breadth, it's a little harder than it looks. In-class exams are almost direct reflections of the study guide, so they're somewhat easy, but lab tests are hard! And the only grades are tests, so if you're not a good test taker, this isn't the class for you.\", \"Highly-recommended colloquium! Dr. Madsen is a bright guy who is incredibly passionate about and involved in the energy field. He discussed many facets of the energy sector and presented a balanced perspective. The class was very clearly structured. As long as you put in the required work and effort, you'll get a good grade in this class.\", \"One of the easiest classes I've taken at UD. 3 essays, 3 group projects, clear criteria. If you just do everything you'll get an A no problem. His lectures are interesting and I liked learning the material. If you have to take an honors colloquium, take Dr. Madsen, you won't regret it.\", \"Madsen is the best. Cares about his students. An A in his class is an 87! Gives extra credit opportunities if you show you care about his class and want to do well. Not a hard course at all, just make sure to know his slides inside and out. Never went to class, didn't buy the textbook, and still did well in his class. Would take Madsen again!\", 'He is an amazing lecturer. He is remarkably organized and uploads the slides prior to the lecture, so during class you can really absorb what he is saying instead of trying to write everything down. His grading scale is fair and his exams are well made. He provides a study guide so you know which topics you may be tested on. Best prof ever!', 'Even if you struggle in madness class if you take time to meet with him he will find ways to boost your grade! not the easy A I thought it would be but not extremely challenging either', \"So here's the deal: Madsen is dope but this class is not if you're taking it as a lab requirement. An immense amount of material. Take 105 instead!! But madsen rocks and is helpful and caring!\", 'His tests are based on your memory. You need to memorize everything is required. Average teacher.', \"Dr. Madsen was fantastic. If you're in the honors program, take him for Colloquium. His lectures are interesting, he is an easy grader, and he cares about his students. I hear that he is great for Geology as well. Definitely go with Madsen if you can. Easiest A I've earned in college so far.\"]\n",

She introduced me to a lot of books I wouldn't have normally read, and I enjoyed all of them. I feel like I learned a lot about the craft of writing creative nonfiction essays through her helpful comments.\", \"Prof Horvitz is extremely nice and approachable, she responds to emails quickly, and she makes herself readily available outside of class.
